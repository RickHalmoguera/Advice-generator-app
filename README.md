## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

-Continued to practice the use of picture to show differents img depending of the width of the browser.
-In this project I learn another method to center elements in a DIV, with postion and translate. 
-Learn to get data from an API with fecth in Javascript. 


```html
<picture>
   <source media="(min-width: 430px)" srcset="./images/pattern-divider-desktop.svg">;
   <img src="./images/pattern-divider-mobile.svg" alt="divider">;
</picture>
```
```css
img{
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    top: 50%;
    -webkit-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
     transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
```js

const displayAdvice = (advice)=>{
    adviceNumber.innerText = `advice # ${advice.slip.id}`
    adviceText.innerText = advice.slip.advice
}

const getAdvice = () =>{
    fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(advice => displayAdvice(advice));
}

getAdviceBtn.addEventListener("click",getAdvice )
}
```

- [Drop shadow generator]([https://www.example.com](https://webcode.tools/generators/css/drop-shadow)) - This helped me to make the shadow effect in the button.
- [JavaScript Fetch API]([https://www.example.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/api_fetch.asp)) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the use of fecth.
